# Hashing

Hashing is a method of mapping a specific value to a key generated by a hashing function into a hash table. 

- To perform operations like insert, delete and search in O(1) time, then hashing is required
- In other cases, the time complexity ranges from O(logn) to O(n)
- The worst case complexity for Hashing is still O(n), but average is O(1)
- Efficiency of hashing depends on efficiency of hash function


## Components of Hashing

### Hash Function


### Hash Table
