# Linked Lists

## What is Linked List?

- Data Structure that can be used to store data in nodes
- Each node has two items, *data* & *link* to next node
- Number of nodes is not fixed, hence can be used to dynamically expand & shrink the size of DS
- Entry node is called *head*
- Last node of LL has link = NULL
- Solves problem of memory wastage
