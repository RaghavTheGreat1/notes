### Graphs

A graph is a data structure which consists of nodes as vertices(V) and edges(E), each of which 'joins' two of the nodes. 

Edges in a graph indicate a symmetric relationship between their ends. 



Directed Edge:
- Ordered pair of vertices (u,v)
- First vertex, u is the origin
- Second vertex, v is destination


u -> v



Undirected Edge:

- Unordered pair of vertices (u,v)

u - v


Directed Graph:
- Combination of directed edges

Undirected Graph:
- Combination of undirected edges
