# Google Cloud Digital Leader Notes

### What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources as services over the internet. It eliminates the need for enterprises to procure, configure, or manage resources themselves, and they only pay for what they use.

There are three types of cloud computing service models: 
1. Infrastructure as a service(IaaS ) offers compute and storage services.
2. Platform as a service(PaaS) offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps.
3. Software as a service(SaaS) delivers apps as services.
