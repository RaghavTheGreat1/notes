#MongoDB Basics

###Database
Structered way to store data

##MongoDB
MongoDB is NoSQL Database. NoSQL means data is not stored in tables, i.e. in rows and columns.

MongoDB stores data in form of Documents. These Documents are then stored in collections of documents.

*Collection* - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. 
There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

*Document* - a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.

*Field* - a unique identifier for a datapoint.

*Value* - data related to a given identifier.

##MongoDB Atlas
DaaS - Database as a service

Cluster - group of servers that store your data.

Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.
